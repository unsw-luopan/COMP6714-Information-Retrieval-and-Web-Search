# COMP6714-Information-Retrieval-and-Web-Search

   Wang Wei is the lecturer in this semester. This course is about information retrival. Wang teaches many models in IR part, such as boolean model, vector space model, probability language model, and different evaluation methods. Then he teaches NLP in deep learning part, such as word embedding, RNN, and some variation about NLP in DP part.
 
 
 Wang likes to focus on details, such as the inference of algorithms, or how they can be improved. So before my revision of this course, I do not realize that Wang has already teached several models. Because the teaching is somehow discrete. But when I gradually find the purpose and difference between different models, I have a good comprehension in IR part. Although I know what I learned is just propaedeutic, I think it is quite interesting to learn from micro to macro.
